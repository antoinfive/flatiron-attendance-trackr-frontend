7.7.0 / 2016-03-25
==================

  * v7.7.0
  * Merge pull request [#514](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/514) from kevinburkeshyp/fix-req-no-match
    Fix nock.emitter.on('no match') undefined argument
  * Merge pull request [#512](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/512) from kevinburkeshyp/fix-typo
    Fix typo in tests
  * browserify bundle update
  * request abort destroys socket. fixes [#511](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/511)
  * Fix nock.emitter.on('no match') undefined argument
    Previously if you disabled net connect via `nock.disableNetConnect`,
    `nock.emitter.on('no match')` would return undefined for its first argument,
    since `req` is never initialized. Replaces `req` with `options`, which is
    present and set to a Url instance.
    Fixes the global nock.emitter.on event listener to remove all event listeners
    at the end of each test, otherwise an event listener registered in one test
    might bleed over into the next.
    (This might not be the right fix, I'm happy to change as necessary).
  * Fix typo in tests

  * changelog update

7.3.0 / 2016-02-24
==================

  * v7.3.0
  * browserify bundle update
  * Merge branch 'Limess-remove-interceptor-by-instance'
  * Call removeInterceptor() with instance
    Previously removeInterceptor() only took an options object. This was
    inconvenient if the client didn't wish to expose urls directly in their
    tests.
    removeInterceptor now also takes an instance of `Interceptor` and uses
    the instance variables `baseUrl` and `_key` to filter for removal.
    Added 3 test cases to cover http, https and regex path matching.
  * Use lodash size function
    You cannot effectively compare anything to an empty object declaration. {} === {} will always equal false. This is to address the attended purpose by the comment provided.
